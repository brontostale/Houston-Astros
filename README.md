# 2017 Houston Astros Cheating Scandal Analysis 
As many know in the baseball community, the 2017 World Series champions, the Houston Astros used an elaborate sign stealing scandal to decode pitches and relay them to batters. By banging on a trashcan. They faced serious backlash within the baseball world and media, and many thought this system of stealing signs gave them an unfair advantage, forever tainting their 2017 WS champions trophy. 

After 5 yers the question remains, how much did their system improve offensive production and help win games?

In this repository their are 7 jupiter notebooks in which I use Tony Adams, a Astros fan whom created the famous signstealingscandal.com website and dataset, to analyize for trends and patterns in key baseball statistics that measure a teams offensive production. As an astros fan myself I was deeply invested in understanding the scandals effect on performance as a team and as players. Specifically Jose Altuve, the face of the franchise and 2017 AL MVP. Furthermore, provide audiences of serious, casual, or non-existent baseball fan nature with an analysis and visualizations of the 2017 data.

Note: Their are plenty of Baseball statistics within these notebooks. I explain their meaning where I can. If interested in their definition refer to Fangraphs for more info.
